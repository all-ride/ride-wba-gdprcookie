# Ride: GDRP Cookie notice & modal

## Installation

You can use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) to install this application.

```
composer require ride/web-gdprcookie
```

## Usage

The module includes a script & styling for a cookie banner and a modal where the visitor can select his/her cookie preferences.

For this to work, you will have to add a __template widget__ to the site and __select the "Cookie banner" template__. Make sure you put the widget near the footer of the site and that you do this on the site root, so that the widget gets inherited on all other pages.
